# Twitter IBM Watson Tone Analyzer

Our app processes a search term or hashtag through IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer.
This gives user the ability to receive a general consensus for the overall mood
of a given search term.

App is written in Meteor.js with Blaze, which is a full stack JavaScript framework.
Blaze allows for reactive HTML templates. Meteor.js allows for rapid development
and ease of use. Meteor is builtin with MongoDB.

App skeleton was first written in Python3
