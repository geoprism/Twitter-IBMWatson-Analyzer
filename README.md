# Twitter IBM Watson Tone Analyzer

Our app processes a search term or hashtag through IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer.
This gives user the ability to receive a general consensus for the overall mood
of a given search term.

App is written in Meteor.js with Blaze, which is a full stack JavaScript framework.
Blaze allows for reactive HTML templates. Meteor.js allows for rapid development
and ease of use. Meteor is builtin with MongoDB.
